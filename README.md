# MGS_data

This repository contains the raw data that were used in the analyses of our recent manuscript:"Closing An Eye for the Reliability of Orbital Tightening in Pain Detection: A Simplification of the Mouse Grimace Scale". The paper is currently under review.

The data have 4944 rows and 8 columns. The filename string contains information on video id, animal id, time stamp as well as the intervention status.
Some images showed poor quality and were excluded from the analysis. In case of rejected images, the "rejected" column shows -1.

In total, the algorithm discerned five separate MGS criteria as well as the average score:
* Orbital Tightening
* Nose Bulge
* Cheek Bulge
* Ear Position
* Whisker Change
